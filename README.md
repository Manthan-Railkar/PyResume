# PyResume
PyResume is an AI-powered resume analyzer that compares a candidateâ€™s resume against a given job description. It extracts text from resumes (PDF/Docs), applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) with spaCy to identify key skills, education, and experience, and then generates a detailed report.
